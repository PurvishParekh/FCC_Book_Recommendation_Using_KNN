# FCC_Book_Recommendation_Using_KNN
As a part of freeCodeCamp's Machine Learning with Python curriculam, this projected was developed to recommend five books similar to the book provided in the input(in this case the input is fixed). This model uses K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) to give book similar to the input. This is a simple application of KNN.
